                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I have written this letter to celebrate our one year and two months of our journey together - even the bad, good, arguments and more things we have experienced. I find myself feeling so overwhelmed with gratitude for you, for us and to every moment, smile and challenges we have shared has put us even more together and I cherish this more than words can express.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  But, I want to take this certain moment to address something that’s been weighing heavily on my heart. In recent weeks or even months that I have known I’ve let my emotions get the better of me. I’ve been distant when I should’ve been present, cold when I should’ve been warm, and I’ve let frustration and anger escape in ways that hurt you and for that, I am deeply, deeply sorry.
                    </span>      
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Through all of that, your patience and love have been and always been my guiding light. You remind me my bestest part of who I was once before and inspire me to grow and to be focused on my school work and encourage me to try and achieve the things I love. I can’t thank you enough for being there for me, even times where I was invalidating you, pretending to be a victim and more. You were and always have been my greatest gift that comes in my life. I promise to show you every day to move forward with me.

                    </span>      
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; So cheers to us for our love, our laughter, and our lessons. Let us have the brightest days ahead and for our beautiful future is to build memories with you.
                    </span>
